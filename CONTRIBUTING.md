## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your fork is up to date with the main repository. First, add the main repository as a remote named `upstream` if you haven't already:

    ```sh
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/TheSolaAI/sola-application.git
    ```

    Then, fetch and merge changes from `upstream`:

    ```sh
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout main
    git merge upstream/main
    ```

2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:

    ```sh
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

3. Make your changes and commit them following the [Commit Messages](#commit-messages) guidelines.
4. Push your branch to your fork:

    ```sh
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

5. Open a pull request against the `main` branch of the main repository.
